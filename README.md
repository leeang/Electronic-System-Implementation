#Temperature Controller

controlling the temperature of a aluminum slab to better than 1 degree accuracy over 5 ~ 45 degrees

- A phase-shift oscillator converts actual temperature into frequency
- Arduino measures frequency and computes the corresponding temperature
- A solid-state H bridge controls the current (amplitude and direction) flowing through a TEC
- The desired temperature is set via a infra-red remote
- The observed temperature shows on the LCD screen
