resistance [rɪ'zɪst(ə)ns] n.  
In electrical engineering or physics, resistance is the ability of a substance or an electrical circuit to stop the flow of an electrical current through it. 电阻

reactance [rɪ'ækt(ə)ns] n.  
The opposition to the flow of alternating current by the capacitance or inductance of an electrical circuit; the imaginary part of the impedance , = R + iX, where R is the resistance, i = √–1, and X is the reactance. It is expressed in ohms. 电抗

impedance [ɪm'piːd(ə)ns] n.  
A measure of the opposition to the flow of an alternating current equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the resistance and the reactance, expressed in ohms. 电阻抗

Backlash  
The maximum difference in shaft position that occurs when the shaft is moved to the same actual point from opposite directions.  
In mechanical engineering, backlash, sometimes called lash or play, is clearance or lost motion in a mechanism caused by gaps between the parts. It can be defined as "the maximum distance or angle through which any part of a mechanical system may be moved in one direction without applying appreciable force or motion to the next part in mechanical sequence".
